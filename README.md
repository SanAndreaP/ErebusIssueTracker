Erebus Issue Tracker
==================

This is the repository for bug reports regarding the Erebus, and other things such as commiting lang files and posting ideas.

Feel free to:
- Post any bugs you find.
- Describe properly what you were doing when it happened.
- Post links to pastebin where we can read through your log or crash.
- Post ideas, properly describing what you are thinking of.

Please do read through the other issues to see if something similar has not already been reported. If your bug has already been reported and you think you could explain that bug further, post a comment in that issue.

Keep it clean, people. Use proper grammar, do not swear and be nice to eachother.
