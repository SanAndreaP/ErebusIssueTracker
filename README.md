Erebus Issue Tracker
==================

This is the repository for bug reports regarding the Erebus, and other things such as commiting lang files and posting ideas.

Feel free to:
- Post any bugs you find.
- Describe properly what you were doing when it happened.
- Post links to pastebin where we can read through your log or crash.
- Post ideas, properly describing what you are thinking of.

Please do read through the other issues to see if something similar has not already been reported. If your bug has already been reported and you think you could explain that bug further, post a comment in that issue.

Milestone usage:
- Milestones are used to show what version the issue is in.
- Not much else.

Labels you should use:
These labels are for you to give a brief view of what type of an issue it is, make sure to use them carefully.

- Bug: Something is not behaving as it should.
- Crash: Your game stopped running, or can not run anymore (include a crash report).
- Needs confirmation: You are not sure whether something is actually the case, we will look into it.
- Compatibility: Unexpected cross-mod behaviour and other mod compatibility suggestions and bugs.
- Enhancement: An idea for something that can be improved.
- Idea/suggestion: Full-blown concept idea.
- Question: You are not sure how this should work (NOT for everyday ''I don't know how this works'' questions!).

Labels you shouldn't use:
These labels are for us, the Erebus devs, to attach to your issue.

- Invalid: Not an issue, or proper description has not been given.
- Duplicate: The same issue as another issue.
- Won't fix: This is not our problem, or we can't do anything about it.


Keep it clean, people. Use proper grammar, do not swear and be nice to eachother.
